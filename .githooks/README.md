For project contributors:

Feel free to use this pre-commit hooks in your local setups.

It does the same as the workflows that run on github:
- format the files with black
- linting the files with flake8
- run the tests

Just copy the file into your `.git/hooks/` directory or set it up via a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
