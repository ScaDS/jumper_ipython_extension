"""Replay one cell, however the chosen strategy gets it there, and read back what it cost.

Rebuilding the state a cell needs is the strategy's job (see ``replay``); this
module owns the half that must stay identical no matter which strategy ran:
results come back as a session export, which is then read through the very same
reporter the live review uses, so a variant's metrics are comparable with the
baseline's by construction rather than by convention.
