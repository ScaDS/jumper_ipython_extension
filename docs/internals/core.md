# Core

The core package (`jumper_extension.core`) defines the domain model, configuration, and parsing logic that underpin the JUmPER IPython extension. For the public Python API of `PerfmonitorService`, see the [Python API](../api/python.md) section; the content below focuses on supporting modules and helper functions and is generated directly from the code.

## State

::: jumper_extension.core.state

## Parsers

::: jumper_extension.core.parsers

## Messages

::: jumper_extension.core.messages

## Service helpers

The service itself is documented in the public API; this section exposes the helper functions that construct it.
