Welcome to the documentation for the JUmPER IPython extension, a tool for monitoring the performance of code cells in IPython and Jupyter notebooks.

JUmPER lets you:

- Collect CPU, memory, GPU, and I/O metrics for individual cells.
- View textual performance reports for entire sessions or selected cell ranges.
- Explore interactive plots of collected metrics over time.
- Export performance data and cell history for offline analysis.

To get started quickly, follow the steps in the [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) and [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart.md) guides. For detailed command descriptions and programmatic usage, refer to the [Public API](api/index.md) section.
